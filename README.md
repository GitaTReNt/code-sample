## Overview
This repository contains a partial reproduction of baseline code for using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in seizure classification. The code is designed to demonstrate how GNN-based models can be applied to classify epileptic seizures using temporal and spatial features from EEG or other related time-series data.
